        <h1>Declaration of Jungle cod
            (the spliting of monkey and cod) </h1>
            <p>When the Earth was still young and the rivers first coursed through the land, there thrived a mystical being known as the Jungle Cod™. This enigmatic creature was a bridge between realms, blending the essence of both land and water. The Jungle Cod™ could glide through the water with the swiftness of a monkey and swing through the trees with the agility of a fish. Without the Jungle Cod™, the balance of the world might never have been achieved. For a time, the Jungle Cod™ was the guardian of harmony, ensuring the world’s equilibrium. But as eons passed, the Earth evolved beyond the need for their guidance. The world, now self-sustaining, left the Jungle Cod™ to forge their own destiny. In their quest for purpose, the Jungle Cod™ established a grand civilization, with intricate governance, cities, roads, and currency. They created families and crafted lives of their own, flourishing in their newfound world—until an unforeseen calamity befell them.

 </p> 
   
             <p>The great disaster that befell them was beyond any fish’s wildest nightmares. The rivers, once teeming with life, began to dry up, and a malevolent force known as the Wire began seizing the Jungle Cod™ at will. Their homes were shattered, their children abducted, and their fields withered into barren wastelands. This cataclysmic upheaval was wrought by mankind. By the end of it, only a few hundred Jungle Cod™ remained, faced with the grim decision of whether to stay or to leave. They chose to send their strongest warriors to battle the encroaching threat, hoping that the rest might find refuge in the dwindling waters. When the time came, the bravest of the Jungle Cod™ emerged from the water to confront humanity, never to return. As the waters eventually returned, the remaining Jungle Cod™ transformed into ordinary fish, while those who had ventured onto land became mere monkeys. In the end, the grand pillars of civilization were reduced to simple animals, their once-great minds eroded to mere instinct.
